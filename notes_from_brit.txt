Canticles of Zechariah Luke 1:68-79 after the gospel canticle will always be the same 

I can’t say a specific number since each readings are diff

Our Lord’s Prayer slides will always be the same

After the concluding prayer all are the same

Jubilee Prayer: Monday 
Prayer to Saint Joseph: Tuesday 
Novena to the Sacred Heart is I think every Friday

Yk the first reading, Responsorial Psalm, 
Acclaimation before the gospel, 
and Gospel reading

I stopped typing them all 
I just put 

‘Liturgy of the Word’ 
‘Acclamation Before the Gospel’ 
‘Gospel’ 

From the novena Mass 🤧
So I don’t copy and paste a looot 
and they can just listen or look at the reading at the missalette
